# Snek-Goid
Mostly inspired by the snake game found here:
https://github.com/KyrosDigital/SnakeGame

And the Flocking with Go article found here:
https://sausheong.github.io/posts/flocking-with-go/

This doesn't do much for now but "attempt" to implement the Boid flocking simulation.

## How to run:
```bash
$ python snek_poid.py
```
